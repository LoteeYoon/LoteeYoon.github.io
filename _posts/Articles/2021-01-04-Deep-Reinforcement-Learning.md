>Humans excel at solving a wide variety of challenging problems, from low-level motor control through to high-level cognitive tasks. Our goal at DeepMind is to create artificial agents that can achieve a similar level of performance and generality. Like a human, our agents learn for themselves to achieve successful strategies that lead to the greatest long-term rewards. This paradigm of learning by trial-and-error, solely from rewards or punishments, is known as reinforcement learning (RL). Also like a human, our agents construct and learn their own knowledge directly from raw inputs, such as vision, without any hand-engineered features or domain heuristics. This is achieved by deep learning of neural networks. At DeepMind we have pioneered the combination of these approaches - deep reinforcement learning - to create the first artificial agents to achieve human-level performance across many challenging domains.

인간은 저차원의 motor control에서부터 고차원의 인지 작업에 이르기까지 다양한 문제를 해결하는 데 탁월하며, Deepmind의 목표는 인간과 비슷한 수준의 능력을 달성할 수 있는 artificial agents를 만드는 것이라고 합니다.

agent는 인간처럼 Long-term rewards를 가장 크게 이끌어내는 전략을 스스로 학습하고, 이러한 시행착오에 의해 학습하는 paradigm을 RL이라고 합니다.
